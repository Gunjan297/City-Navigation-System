# City-Navigation-System
This is a comprehensive city navigation system in C++ to guide users through Shimla’s picturesquetourist destinations

◦ The system features an intuitive interface to explore and navigate the city effectively, offering functionalitiessuch as:

1.Multi-Route Pathfinding: which retrieves all possible paths from a source to a destination using graph algorithms like BFS/DFS and Backtracking

2.Route Details: which provides shortest paths, distances, travel fares and time between destinations using greedy approach and advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm(integrated multiple transportation modes (walking, driving, public transport) and dynamically calculates fare and travel time based on user preferences)

3.Tourist Spot Ratings: where travelers can add and view reviews and ratings for destinations using File Handling

4.Personalized Recommendations: suggests attractions based on categories like nature, adventure, history to users.

◦ Tools Used: C++, Data Structures and Algorithm, File Handling, User Input/Interaction
